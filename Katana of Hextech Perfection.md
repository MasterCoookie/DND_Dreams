Longsword staty: 1d8 Slashing versitile (1d10)

This Katana is embeded with hextech power. It uses hextech energy to enchance its user while attacking, but requires charging it by striking oponents.

Missing an attack with this weapon decreases its bonus by -1, for the minimum of -3.
Landing an attack with this weapon increases its bonus by +1, for the maximum of +3.

When fully charged (at +3 bonus), the user can, as an action, set the bonus down to -3 and cast Lightning Bolt without expanding a spell slot.
