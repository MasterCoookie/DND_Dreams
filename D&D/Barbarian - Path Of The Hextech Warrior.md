#homebrew #subclass
***Barbarians who walk the Path of the Hextech Warrior draw their rage from the astounding invention which connects technology and magic called HEXTECH. And it - draws from them. After all, rage is energy... And energy... It can be put to use!***

# Hextech Armament
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can now bond with a hextech weapon. These techno-magical artifacts are a rare and valuable piece of hardware. Usually crafted by legendary Artificer. It's up to you and your DM to determine, how you would get into a possession of one. All features of you hextech weapon are available only when you are raging. You can get into a possession of one before before you reach level 3, work closely with your DM to determine this.

## Hextech Die
You gain a hextech die, used in variety of your actions. Your hextech die increases with your barbarian level. To use this, or any other feature of this subclass, you have to be rageing.

| Barbarian Level | Hextech die |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | d4 |
| 6 | d6 |
| 10 | d8 |
| 14 | d10 |
| 17 | d12|

## Hextech Powervessel™
The weapon can be charged with magical energy. The maximum amount of charges can be calculated as:

**Max charges = (Your Barbarian Level + Your Proficiency Bonus)**

Energy used to power the weapon is drawn directly from its surroundings. The weapon gains, and looses charges while attacking and taking damage. 

**Power gained/lost = damage delt/taken ÷ 3**

If you take damage, subtract calculated power. If you deal damage, add it.

Overcharged weapon will release it's excess energy in order to avoid critical failure. Respectably if it is undercharged, it will draw energy from its surroundings. **If at the start of you turn you have exceeded maximum power, or reached negative, roll a d4 and subtract/add rolled amount to your power. Then, immediately apply effect from table below.**

Overcharged:

| d4 | Effect |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | **Minor discharge:** During this turn, if your attack hits, both you and the target take an additional **hextech die** lighting damage|
| 2 | **Wild Swings:** During this turn, your attacks count as Recless Attacks   |
| 3 | **Glitch:** Make a free melee attack against a random creature within reach |
| 4 | **Emergency Discharge:** All creatures (including you) within a 10 foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes your proficiency bonus x **hextech die** lightning damage or half as much on successful one

Undercharged:
 
| d4 | Effect |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | **Targeting Systems Failure:** Roll a **hextech die** and subtract this amount from you next attack made with your hextech weapon  |
| 2 | **Temporary blackout:** Your hextech weapon cannot be used this turn |
| 3 | **Emergency Recharge:** You take 2 x **hextech die** necrotic damage |
| 4 | **Backup Power Source:** Your rage ends. You must make a Constitution saving throw, or be Incapacitated. You can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of your turns|

| 4 | **Discompobulate:** Make a melee weapon attack against a creature. If the attack hits, the creature takes additional **hextech die** lightning damage and has to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, attacks against it have advantage until the start of your next turn.
